# UIDproject
This is the prototype for the project user interface design by Arno De Witte and Kwinten Pardon.

## Running
To run open the `index.html` file in any web browser. Note that IE 10 is required, chrome and firefox should work fine.
Logging in as `bad@student.be` will grant access to a private question. Logging in as `mathteacher@personel.be` will give you admin rights within the math course. Equally for other courses.
When refreshing all questions and responses will be lost as this is a prototype!
