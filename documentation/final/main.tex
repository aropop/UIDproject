\section{Application Description}
The application focuses on students and professors at the university. This application allows for them to ask questions and give responses. They are able to log in into the application using their university credentials. Students are able to navigate through the courses they are registered for. Per course a student is able to see the questions asked by his fellow students and he's able to ask question of his own. A professor sees the courses he is responsible for. Per course the professor sees the questions asked by his students and is able to answer them. Due to these interactions, a knowledge base per course is formed. Professors can choose to close questions if they find that they are sufficiently answered. Because some questions might be irrelevant for other students, the student may choose to make a question private so that only the professor can see the question.

\section{Prototype}
A prototype has been developed as a web application. This choose was made as it seemed the most relevant for an actual working product. The prototype of our application can be found attached to this document. There is also a live version which can be found on \url{http://aropop.github.io/UIDproject/}. Note that the functionality of this prototype is written in JavaScript. Which means that when closing and reopening the page, all user data will be erased.\\
To use the application as a student (see section \ref{sec:Users}) the user should login using \emph{bad@student.be} or \emph{good@student.be}. Logging in as \emph{mathteacher@personel.be} will allow you to be the professor for the math course in the prototype.

\section{Users}\label{sec:Users}
The application is based on 2 existing user classes. It contains students who are taking courses on the one hand and professors in charge of said courses on the other. The application does not require a super user since the application is based in a university environment and all data should be imported from other already existing databases or applications.

\subsection{User Classes}

\subsubsection{Student}

\begin{tabular}{ | l | p{10cm} |}
\hline
\textbf{Type} & Primary User \\ \hline
\textbf{Usage frequency} & Daily Use \\ \hline
\textbf{Computer experience} & Novice \\ \hline
\textbf{Application familiarity} & From novice as first degree bachelor student to competent performer in second degree master student. Application shows familiarity's with other applications such as Pointcarre\\ \hline
\textbf{Usage} & discretionary\\ \hline
\textbf{Number of users} & 12.000+\\ \hline
\textbf{Motivation} & 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Positive 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item eliminates the search for contact information
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize} \\ \hline
\textbf{tasks} & 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Watch overview of courses (number of new questions / new answers per course)
		\item Watch overview of questions status per course (answered, follow-up question unanswered, unanswered)
		\item Ask a question regarding a course (public or private)
		\item Mark a question as answered (only if he is the original person who asked the question)
		\item Ask follow-up question
	\end{itemize} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Professor}

\begin{tabular}{ | l | p{10cm} |}
\hline
\textbf{Type} & Primary User \\ \hline
\textbf{Usage frequency} & Daily Use \\ \hline
\textbf{Computer experience} & Novice \\ \hline
\textbf{Application familiarity} & Competent Performer due to similarities with other systems such as Pointcarre \\ \hline
\textbf{Usage} & Mandatory\\ \hline
\textbf{Number of users} & 700\\ \hline
\textbf{Motivation} & 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Positive 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Questions, separated by class instead of cluttered in email inbox
			\item Preventing duplicate questions by making a question public
		\end{itemize}
		\item Negative 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Might prefer email
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize} \\ \hline
\textbf{tasks} & 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Watch overview of courses (number off new questions, follow up questions per course)
		\item Watch questions per course (unanswered new, unanswered follow up question, answered)
		\item Filter questions (unanswered new, unanswered follow up question, answered)
		\item Change private question to public
		\item Answer (follow-up) question
		\item Discard question (refuse to answer)
	\end{itemize} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{User Models}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{img/orm.png}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item User has two subclasses, one for each user type
\item A student follows multiple courses
\item A student asks multiple questions
\item A professor answers multiple questions
\item A professor is in charge of multiple courses
\item A course is followed by multiple students
\item A course contains multiple questions
\item A course has multiple responsible professors
\item A question is related to a single course
\item A question can be asked by only one student
\item A question can be answered by only one professor

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Users should be able to log in, within 10 seconds using their university credentials.
	\item Users should be able to navigate to the right course within 30 seconds.
	\item Students should be able to start the process of asking a question within 10 seconds. (Time on completing this task is dependant on the complexity of the question).
	\item Professors should be able to start the process of answering a question within 10 seconds. (Time on completing this task is dependant on the complexity of the question).
	\item Users should be able to find a question within 10 seconds. (only if they're already in the right course. If not time required to navigate to the right course should be included making it 40 seconds)
	\item Users should be able to change the status of a question instantly, provided the question already has been found.
	\item Users should be able to change the visibility of a question instantly, provided the question already has been found.
