\section{Application Description}
Our application eliminates the search for contact information for the professor in charge of a certain course. It enables the student to ask a question, related to a course he follows, in a fast and straightforward manner. The application will also list the questions asked by his fellow students and the given answers. This way, a knowledge base
per course is formed.

\section{Users}
The application is based on 2 existing user classes. It contains students who are taking courses on the one hand and professors in charge of said courses on the other. The application does not require a super user since the application is based in a university environment and all data should be imported from other already existing databases or applications.
