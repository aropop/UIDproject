\section{Application Description}
Our application eliminates the search for contact information for the professor in charge of a certain course. It enables the student to ask a question, related to a course he follows, in a fast and straightforward manner. The application will also list the questions asked by his fellow students and the given answers. This way, a knowledge base
per course is formed.

\section{Users}
The application is based on 2 existing user classes. It contains students who are taking courses on the one hand and professors in charge of said courses on the other. The application does not require a super user since the application is based in a university environment and all data should be imported from other already existing databases or applications.

\subsection{User Classes}

\subsubsection{Student}

\begin{tabular}{ | l | p{10cm} |}
\hline
\textbf{Type} & Primary User \\ \hline
\textbf{Usage frequenty} & Daily Use \\ \hline

\subsection{Usability Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Users should be able to log in, within 10 seconds using their university credentials.
	\item Users should be able to navigate to the right course within 30 seconds.
	\item Students should be able to start the process of asking a question within 10 seconds. (Time on completing this task is dependant on the complexity of the question).
	\item Professors should be able to start the process of answering a question within 10 seconds. (Time on completing this task is dependant on the complexity of the question).
	\item Users should be able to find a question within 10 seconds. (only if they're already in the right course. If not time required to navigate to the right course should be included making it 40 seconds)
	\item Users should be able to change the status of a question instantly, provided the question already has been found.
	\item Users should be able to change the visibility of a question instantly, provided the question already has been found.
	\item Users should be able to log out within 5 seconds.
