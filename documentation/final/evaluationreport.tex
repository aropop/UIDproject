When designing this prototype we started out by sketching the design on paper. We tried to make the best possible model to fit our requirements. Then we created the wireframes. These are quite hard to iteratively improve, therefore we set out to create a working prototype as fast as possible. When we created the prototype we each evaluated the parts of the prototype each member had created. In this phase already some improvements were made. For example the email verification was improved by adding the support to just press enter.\\
In a second phase the prototype was send to another group for evaluation. There evaluation was very helpful as it provided an independent view on our prototype. The group pointed out some flaws in our prototype, such as the meaning of each icon and the fact that the placement of some buttons might be odd for new users. Therefor we added some tool tips and a help button which reveals an overlay that points to all features that might not be obvious to new users. Other small improvements were made based on this report which is included with this report.
