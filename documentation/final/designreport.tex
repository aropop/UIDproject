\subsection{Problem Definition}
The goal of this project was to create a platform to enable students to ask questions in relation to a certain class they follow. Professors in turn would be able to answers these question.

We decided on 2 user classes, students and professor. You can read the user classes in detail in section \ref{sec:User_classes}

The tasks, as defined in section \ref{sec:CTT} consist of the following procedures

\begin{itemize}
\item Log in
\item Log out
\item View courses
\item View questions
\item Ask question
\item Answer question
\item Change visibility off question
\item Change status of question
\item Search for question
\end{itemize}

We were unable to complete the creation of the task models via the MARIA tool provided. When trying to download the task models, we were faced with a network error.

several iterations have gone over both the wireframes as the digital prototype. The prototype can be found running on http://aropop.github.io/UIDproject/ and the wireframes have been included as attachment
